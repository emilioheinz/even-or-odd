This project serves as a practical proof of concept, closely tied to my blog article titled [Increase React render performance by avoiding unnecessary useEffects](https://emiliosheinz.com/posts/increase-react-render-performance-by-avoiding-unnecessary-useeffects). By examining this repository, you can witness firsthand how the concept of creating derived states, rather than new states, in certain React scenarios can significantly enhance your application's performance by eliminating unnecessary re-renders. Dive into the codebase to explore real-world implementations and gain a deeper understanding of this optimization technique, ultimately optimizing your React applications for peak efficiency.
